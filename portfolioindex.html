        <h2> My Projects</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Project 1: LookBook Dress Up Game.</strong> 
            <br><br> Lead a team of three to create a user-friendly game with nostalgic values and a great impact. While this game can be enjoyed by any age group, it is mainly targeted at university students as playing this game can be an entertaining break from the stress of university; Most of our age fellows have spent their childhood indulging in such dress-up games, and therefore, the nostalgia is aimed to provide the users with comfort. It allows the users to customize their fun avatars and maximize their creativity, which earned the team a grade of A+.
            <ul id="project">
                <li>Led a dynamic team of three to achieve remarkable success in a complex project, securing an A+ grade through effective leadership and surpassing expectations.</li>
                <li>Employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Sublime Text as the primary IDE, Eclipse as the primary server for coding, collaboration, and testing.</li>
                <li>Used JavaScript to seamlessly embed audio in the website, and error-catching mechanisms addressed security permissions across different browsers.</li>
                <li>Utilized HTML libraries like html2canvas and dom-to-image, enabling users to download customized images of avatars and designs in .png format directly from the web application.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Project 2:Python document analyser </strong> 
            <br><br> Utilized Python and the Python library of os to create a document analyzing a user's inputted folder. 
            <ul id="project">
                <li>Created a project using Python with Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE, where the objective was to dynamically read an input folder from the user's directory and employ a specified keyword to identify files containing the targeted keyword.</li>
                <li>Implemented Python's os module to locate folders seamlessly, systematically traversing a user's directory by leveraging Python extensions and libraries for efficient file system navigation and content analysis.</li>
